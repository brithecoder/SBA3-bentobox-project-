# Reflection Questions

### Challenges you encountered during the project.
I encountered a lot of challenges during this project.The masonry grid or bento box layout was the most prominent.Having to do if not all, most of my styling in accordance with the bootstraps components really hindered the execution of the design.
I didnt get the grid as close to the design as I would have liked but maybe if I had more time or used different css lib I could have achieved a more desiable outcome. 


### Your approach to solving these challenges.
I had to plug and play with the grid system used with bootstraps mostly adding a number of breakpoints for the columns and having rows within the columns and vice versa.I could have found a better solution maybe not utilizing bootstraps.I also tried using the Masonry library but I had trouble utilizing the tool and due to time constrains had to move on to finding a different solution. 


### Improvements you would make if given more time.
Impovements I would make is the layout of the grid and also the responsiveness of the components when in moble view. Also I would add more custom CSS styling to the components using sass and mixins.
